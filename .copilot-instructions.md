# Copilot Instructions

## General Guidelines

- **Avoid unnecessary refactors**: Only refactor code when explicitly asked to do so. Focus on the specific task at hand rather than making broad changes to existing working code.

- **Write small, reusable components**: Break down functionality into small, focused components that can be easily reused across the application. Each component should have a single responsibility.

- **Do not run scripts for verification**: Unless specifically requested, avoid running scripts, tests, or other verification commands. Focus on making the requested changes without executing additional validation steps.

- **Do not run commands in the terminal unless asked**: Avoid executing any terminal commands or scripts unless explicitly instructed to do so.

- **Check and fix editor errors**: Always check for errors in the editor after making changes and fix them if possible. Use the available error checking tools to ensure code quality and functionality.

- **Do not add new features or buttons unless specifically requested**: Only implement new functionality or UI elements when explicitly asked to do so.

## Component Design Principles

- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Make components reusable by accepting props for customization
- Use proper TypeScript types for better code safety
- Follow established patterns in the codebase

## Code Quality

- Maintain consistency with existing code style
- Use proper error handling where appropriate
- Follow React and Next.js best practices
- Ensure proper imports and exports
